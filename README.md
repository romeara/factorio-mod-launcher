Launcher to allow switching between sets of Mods when playing factorio

# Use

Download a release from the releases page, and place on your system. Run via `java -jar <jar location>`. It is recommended to create a shortcut to perform this operation

The launcher manages the "enabled" state of mods (not the versions of mods used)
